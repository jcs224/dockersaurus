# Dockersaurus

## Simple GUI for managing your Docker containers. Built with Deno.

Most docker GUIs are too hard for me to use. They are focused on being able to do everything you can do in with the Docker CLI. Dockersaurus takes a different approach by making it easy to create, start, and stop containers, and not much else. It's a very minimal project.
